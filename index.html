<p>
Sport is basically all my life, I started doing sport at the age of 5 by judo. And all my life I did a lot of other sports such as Soccer, Tennis, Boxing, MMA, Basketball and American Football 
</p>

<div class="little-card-grey">
<h3>Basketball</h3>
<p>
Basketball played a huge part in my life simply because it has forged my personnality and my body. Even if I stopped playing Basketball, I keep watching games and work hard like a basketball player.

<h3>American Football</h3>
<p> 
I started to watch the NFL when I was like 12 years old but it's only this year (2019) that I started playing American Football with the PULV team : the Eagles.

<h3>Bodybuilding</h3>
<p>
I started going to the gym at the age of 15 but I was doing body weight exercices when I was 13, I really wanted to have a good physic condition for the sport I was doing and today I have to go the gym often thanks to the American Football. Go to the gym is one of my favourite hobby.

Travelling is a beautiful thing it allows everyone to discover new things, new cultures and obviously having a good time.

<h3>United States
</h3>
<p>
I have been to the United States 3 times : in New York, Miami and on a road trip in the West coast. And this is for the moment my favourite country, when I was young I was dreaming to go there and it didn't disapointed me at all, I liked everything I just lived one of my dreams.
